The mastermind...

In this game, player 1 chooses an ordered set of colors and player 2 tries to guess the set.
Player 1 provides feedback to each try in the form of
black tokens for colors in correct position and
white tokens for colors in incorrect position.
Player 2 wins when feedback is zero white token and as much black tokens as the hidden set size.
Player 1 wins after a given unsuccessful tries.

For example
    Say the hidden colors are blue, white, red
    When the guess is         blue, white, red
    Then the feedback is 3 black, 0 white

Other examples
    Hidden: blue, white, red

    green, green, green -> 0 black, 0 white
    blue, green, green  -> 1 black, 0 white
    blue, white, green  -> 2 black, 0 white
    green, green, red   -> 1 black, 0 white
    white, red, blue    -> 0 black, 3 white
    blue, blue, blue    -> 1 black, 0 white
